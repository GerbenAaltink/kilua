* Testing and stability to reach "usable" level.
* Duplicating a row should trigger to Lua

* Refactor KILO_QUIT_TIMES / quit_times everywhere to KILO_CONFIRM_TIMES 
  and confirm_times since it's used for duplicating and deleting lines as well
* Pasting content should not mess up statistics like key pressed count
* Show current file in second bar at the bottom calculate how much chars
